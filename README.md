# POKEMON APP
  

This project uses Flutter version 3.13.5 and Dart version 3.1.2. Please make sure to upgrade your Flutter version, or you can use [FVM](https://fvm.app/) for version management.

  

To get started, create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill in the values for the variables (you can find examples in the `.env.example` file).

  

Execute the following commands to generate necessary files in this project:

  

```bash

flutter  clean && flutter  pub  get && flutter  pub  run  build_runner  build  --delete-conflicting-outputs

```

  

Or, if you are using FVM:

  

```bash

fvm  flutter  clean && fvm  flutter  pub  get && fvm  flutter  pub  run  build_runner  build  --delete-conflicting-outputs

```

  

To running 
  

```bash

flutter  run 

```

  

Or, with FVM:

  

```bash

fvm  flutter  run 

```
